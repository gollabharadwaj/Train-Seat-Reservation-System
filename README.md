# Project Description: Train Seat Reservation System
The Train Seat Reservation System is a web-based application designed to facilitate the booking of train seats in an efficient and user-friendly manner. This system allows users to reserve up to seven seats at a time, with a focus on maximizing seat utilization by prioritizing bookings in a single row before considering nearby seats.

## Key Features:
User-Friendly Interface: The application provides a simple input form for users to specify the number of seats they wish to book.
Dynamic Seat Layout: The seating arrangement is displayed in a visually appealing format, showing available and booked seats using color-coded buttons.
Real-Time Booking Logic: The system checks for available seats and attempts to fulfill booking requests in the most optimal way.
Initial Seat Availability: The application simulates real-world scenarios by starting with some seats marked as unavailable, allowing users to experience the booking process realistically.
### Technical Details:
Frontend: Built with Angular, utilizing components for modular structure and responsive design.
Styling: The application employs CSS for a colorful interface, enhancing user experience through modern design elements and fonts from Google Fonts.
Seat Management: An array-based structure is used to manage seat availability, allowing for efficient tracking of booked and available seats.
## Purpose:
This project aims to provide an intuitive platform for train seat reservations, improving the booking experience for users while demonstrating practical skills in web development, including frontend design and dynamic content management.
